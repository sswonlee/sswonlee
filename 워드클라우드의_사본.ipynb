Right, this is the new approach to economic warfare. Become docile in economic play by going full consumer and productive enough to live and provide your \"disposable\" earnings as profits for metaverse digital assets. that being said, I do find this to be interesting from a creative standpoint, for new immersive experiences, people will always want to play. Its why microtransactions worked for a lot of MMO and even single player games via expansion packs. They are truly new experiences, whether its new campaign mission stories (basically playable movies), new weapons for you favorite games, or secret content for your super fans. People buy autographed memorabilia in the real world or value rare defective products, or mis-minted coin. Humans hoard subjective value due to the experience tied to them. I dont see this being a huge hit outside of AR or VR creative applications for sale. Most other sales will be from kids stealing credit cards to buy useless goods, fans/backers who want to fit into a niche social circle. Manipulating our rights in the real world might force people to further partake in this, or maybe physical incapacitation. It is a real market no doubt, as it has been with the other titles people are bringing up, just spruced up for the modern era if they get it right. But real physical world assets will always be REAL ESTATE. No problem with businesses trying to create another income stream with a more advanced creative endeavor, I applaud it, but this buying mania for digital real estate is kind of loopy. Children have by far been the most exploited target for financial resource gain by uncreative adults playing in a creative space. It all comes down to how they can profit. Snake oil continues to stock the free market\\'s shelves.\\n', 'People spending most their waking hours in a virtual reality is more indicative of a real world no longer meeting the emotional and psychological needs of humans.

As for the NFT‘s, I found it to be all right to create an icon of whatever thing or person, put a price tag on it and aspire for someone to buy it. But please, NO! images of human beings whose lower part of the body is missing and also of those who can jump from one skyscraper to the next, will not bring about the right representation of reality in the minds of young boys and girls. There exists, definitely, the possibility that these young minds who are fed the wrong image of the world end up becoming delusional a.k.a. psychotic, namely adults who live on this planet but whose world is a fictitious world that they have deeply entrenched in their minds, the product of their early indoctrination via games.\\n', \"I feel so lucky because I don't have to go through all this stress to trade well.\\n\", 'Wow.

Um, nope, there is less than 1/10th of 1% of people who\\'ve played Fortnite who have played it in VR since technically it doesn\\'t even exist yet.

Second Life didn\\'t even start this.

I know, I had a whole virtual world there myself. (You could purchase your own virtual world and you would show up on the list of available worlds. You could even limit who could come in, etc...) Active Worlds is still around for those who are interested in the real history of this. Upland inspired by Stranger Things? Um, nope... again, virtual real estate sales have existed for decades in Second Life. But Upland has real world addresses and NFT\\'s you say? Well think about it, the virtual land doesn\\'t really require NFT\\'s since it isn\\'t like anyone can hand out copies of your virtual world. The real world addresses? Active Worlds and Second Life had these. But you have an NFT of that real world address? No, actually, you have an NFT of that version of a real world address. There is nothing stopping someone from making another version of that real world location, and better. But it\\'s the first, so it has historical value... Um no, since as was mentioned it\\'s so late to the \\'real world addresses in a virtual world\\' that no one will care. it\\'s a gimmick. In short, this is pure marketing bs.

Right, this is the new approach to economic warfare. Become docile in economic play by going full consumer and productive enough to live and provide your \"disposable\" earnings as profits for metaverse digital assets. that being said, I do find this to be interesting from a creative standpoint, for new immersive experiences, people will always want to play. Its why microtransactions worked for a lot of MMO and even single player games via expansion packs. They are truly new experiences, whether its new campaign mission stories (basically playable movies), new weapons for you favorite games, or secret content for your super fans. People buy autographed memorabilia in the real world or value rare defective products, or mis-minted coin. Humans hoard subjective value due to the experience tied to them. I dont see this being a huge hit outside of AR or VR creative applications for sale. Most other sales will be from kids stealing credit cards to buy useless goods, fans/backers who want to fit into a niche social circle. Manipulating our rights in the real world might force people to further partake in this, or maybe physical incapacitation. It is a real market no doubt, as it has been with the other titles people are bringing up, just spruced up for the modern era if they get it right. But real physical world assets will always be REAL ESTATE. No problem with businesses trying to create another income stream with a more advanced creative endeavor, I applaud it, but this buying mania for digital real estate is kind of loopy. Children have by far been the most exploited target for financial resource gain by uncreative adults playing in a creative space. It all comes down to how they can profit.

But please, NO! images of human beings whose lower part of the body is missing and also of those who can jump from one skyscraper to the next, will not bring about the right representation of reality in the minds of young boys and girls.
